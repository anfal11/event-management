###### 2. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `TypeError`
- C: `"12"`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

<i>JavaScript performs type coercion when performing operations, so it converts the number 1 and the string "2" to the same data type, which is a string. Then, it concatenates the two strings, resulting in the string "12".</i>

###### 3. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = "🍝";

console.log(food);
```

- A: `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- B: `['🍝', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- C: `['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

<i>The code first creates an array food with four elements. Then, it creates an object info with a property favoriteFood that initially references the first element of the food array, which is "🍕". Later, it updates the info.favoriteFood property to "🍝". However, this change does not affect the food array itself, so the food array remains unchanged, and its elements are still "🍕", "🍫", "🥑", and "🍔".</i>

###### 4. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}

console.log(sayHi());
```

- A: `Hi there,`
- B: `Hi there, undefined`
- C: `Hi there, null`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

<i> The sayHi function expects a parameter name, but when it's called as sayHi(), no argument is provided there. In JavaScript, when a function is called without the expected arguments, the missing parameters are set to undefined. So, the function returns "Hi there, undefined" because name is undefined in this context.</i>

###### 5. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});

console.log(count);
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

<i>The forEach method iterates over each element in the nums array. In JavaScript, 0 is considered a "falsy" value, and all other numbers are "truthy." So, the condition if (num) evaluates to true for all elements except 0, which means the count will increment for all non-zero numbers in the array. Since there are three non-zero numbers (1, 2, and 3) in the array, the count variable will be incremented three times, resulting in a value of 3</i>
